# Verilog_Basic_Gates_Implementation
Welcome to the "VerilogBasicGatesImplementation" repository! This project showcases the implementation of fundamental digital logic gates using the Verilog hardware description language (HDL). Digital logic gates are the build This repository provides concise Verilog code for commonly used gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR.
