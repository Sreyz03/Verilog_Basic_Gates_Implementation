# Verilog_Basic_Gates_Implementation

Welcome to the "VerilogBasicGatesImplementation" repository! This project showcases the implementation of fundamental digital logic gates using the Verilog hardware description language (HDL). Digital logic gates are the build This repository provides concise Verilog code for commonly used gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR.

Key Features:
Clear and concise Verilog code for basic logic gates.
Well-documented source code to aid understanding and modification.
Educational resource for Verilog beginners and digital design enthusiasts.
Easy integration into larger Verilog projects for more complex digital systems.
